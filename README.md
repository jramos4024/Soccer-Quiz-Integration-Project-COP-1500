# Soccer Quiz Integration Project

Author: Joe Ramos

Description: This is a beginner level python program developed as part of my intro to computer science class. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, user input, and basic logic through an interactive soccer quiz.

Purpose: The purpose of this project was to practice fundamental programming logic and apply concepts learned early in an introductory computer science course.
